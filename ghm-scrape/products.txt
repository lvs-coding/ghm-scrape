This research’s aim was to search for anti dust-mites substance mainly from herb, as an alternative to overcome the problem associated with using chemical based anti dust-mites product in other countries, which carries an adverse side effect to users. The ultimate finding leads to some familiar herbs like clove, cinnamon, which are heat-radiated and scented type of herbs, together with several Thai herbal extract which can get rid of dust-mites. And a mixture of right proportions of these can create a formulation capable of eradicating dust-mites 100% effective; while being safe to users’ health, as it is entirely made of herbal extracts.

Spraying the product inside the room twice in the first month 7 – 10 days in between the 2 spray applications and thereafter, once a month to keep out dust-mites which may come back again with the clothing we wear. And people with serious dust-mites allergy problem like Asthma, or allergy problem causing severely irritating rashes on the skin, then the use of vacuum cleaning to suck away getting rid of the remains of dust-mites after spray application for the first and second times only Is recommended, and thereafter, vacuum cleaning every 6 months in good enough.However, even without vacuum cleaning after spraying, the product is effectively reliable as aLGy can reduce harmful level of allergen, the procedure has been tested continually for effectiveness on actual patients during the 10 years of research period with satisfactory result, but the level of effectiveness varies depending on the severity of the allergic cases, as well as individual’s physical well being.
